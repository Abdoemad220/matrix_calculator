# matrix_calculator
It is required to develop a console application that performs different operations
on matrices. The application should support:
● Addition of two matrices.
● Subtraction of two matrices.
● Multiplication of two matrices.
● Division of two matrices.
● Calculation of determinant of a matrix.
The program needs to be interactive, it asks the user first to supply dimensions of
the matrices, then fill values in each. Then the user of the program is asked to
choose the type of operation or choose to quit, then displays the calculated
output based on the user’s choice. The program keeps asking the user for inputs
until the user decides to quit.
